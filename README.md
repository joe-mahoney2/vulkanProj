well see where this goes  

Alrighty going to break this up into a few sections to start.  

1. What i'm using   
    a  -shell = git bash https://git-scm.com/downloads
    b  -visual studio (for now)  
    c  -visual studio code  
    d  -glfw - git clone https://github.com/charles-lunarg/vk-bootstrap.git  
    e  -vk-bootstrap - git clone https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git  

2. Objectives  
    a  -Boil down in some way (TBD), further boil down glfw and the setup   
        portion of vk-bootstrap into perhapse seperate helper classes that   
        handle all of the setup via constructors/ cleanup via destructors  
  
3. Current issues (feel free to work ahead with whatever workaround you can find)  
    a  -Need to install .lib files and include files into /modules/include /modules/lib  

4.  PS
    a  -both glfw and vk-bootstrap have example src code within and .exe's
